### Sequence Alignment Graph Generation ###
Using NetworkX and PyQt6, this approach consists in an interface allowing to enter the name of a file or its path and realize an interaction graph showing how close each sequence is.

Given here is an example fasta file, that unfortunately is made out of another alignment, so the values are extremely close to each other, but you are welcomed to use your own set of sequences in a unique fasta file.

## Execution ##
You only need Execute.py to be running the program
